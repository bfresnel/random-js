# RANDOM-JS #

This project is a personnal project. It will contains some research i made in order to increase my knowledge about the Javascript / Typescript language. It can be a tool i wanted to use, some practice, some test i don't know 🤓

Just find yourself a folder that can catch your curiosity by his name ! 😁

<u>Needed tools :</u>
